# GPU Reproduction Backend

## Purpose

The GPU reproduction backend moves one full generation of selection and variation off the CPU hot path while preserving the public GP contract:

- public program representation remains prefix `AstProgram`
- public selection remains tournament-based and controlled by `selection_pressure`
- public crossover remains `typed_subtree`
- public mutation remains the single public mutation path controlled by `mutation_subtree_prob`

The backend is designed to reduce one-generation benchmark cost and to support overlap with GPU fitness evaluation. It is a performance implementation detail, not a new public GP dialect.

Canonical timing names and CLI/JSON output mapping are documented in
[timing.md](../reference/timing.md).

## Public Controls

The public control plane is:

- `--repro-backend {cpu|gpu}`
- `--repro-overlap {on|off}`

The benchmark script exposes four formal modes built from those controls:

- `cpu`
- `gpu_eval`
- `gpu_repro`
- `gpu_repro_overlap`

`gpu_repro_overlap` overlaps reproduction input preparation with GPU fitness evaluation. The overlap changes timing visibility, not the public reproduction API.

## Pipeline

One `gpu` reproduction pass is split into the following stages.

### 1. Prepare Inputs

Source files:

- [gpu.cpp](../../cpp/src/evolution/repro/gpu.cpp)
- [prep.cpp](../../cpp/src/evolution/repro/prep.cpp)
- [types.hpp](../../cpp/include/gagp/evolution/repro/types.hpp)

The host extracts:

- the current population
- scored fitness values
- backend configuration limits

It then computes the preprocessing data needed by device kernels:

- subtree end positions
- typed crossover candidate ranges
- typed donor pool entries, bucketed by result type for subtree mutation

If `--grammar-config PATH` is active, this preprocessing stage filters typed candidate ranges to grammar-allowed subtrees and builds the donor pool with the selected `grammar-config` search-space controls. Checked-in `grammar-config` presets remain accepted as compatibility input and are translated before use. Generated `compact` configs with legacy `num_list_mode=both` also seed exact numeric-list fixture inputs as `Any` for search-space compatibility. Runtime execution remains the full public grammar superset with exact fixture values; the config only controls search-space generation.

When ASGP forms are enabled by the grammar config, donor preprocessing may
synthesize conservative ASGP donors. ASGP-DC donors may appear in the `Int`,
`Float`, and `String` donor buckets; the `String` slice traverses a `String`
source as chars and rebuilds strings with `singleton(index(...))` and
`concat`. ASGP-DP1D and ASGP-DP2D donors may appear in the `Int`, `Float`,
and `String` donor buckets; the `String` DP slices use `concat` transitions
over memoized dependency results. These donors use the same host-side typed expression generator
as CPU subtree mutation and are still subject to normal donor-size,
grammar-config, and metadata packing limits.

This stage is reported as:

- `repro_prepare_inputs_ms`
- `repro_preprocess_ms`

### 2. Pack

Source files:

- [pack.cpp](../../cpp/src/evolution/repro/pack.cpp)
- [pack.hpp](../../cpp/include/gagp/evolution/repro/pack.hpp)

The host flattens the typed AST population into bounded GPU-friendly arrays:

- plain node buffers
- per-program metadata
- candidate tables
- compact name id tables
- compact constant tables
- `LinearRec` binder side tables for parent and donor programs
- ASGP-DC, ASGP-DP1D, and ASGP-DP2D binder/spec side tables for parent and
  donor programs
- donor pool buffers

This stage is reported as `repro_pack_ms`.

### 3. Upload

Source files:

- [arena.cu](../../cpp/src/evolution/repro/gpu/arena.cu)
- [launch.cu](../../cpp/src/evolution/repro/gpu/launch.cu)

Packed host buffers are uploaded into a reusable device arena. The same arena is retained inside the process and grown only when capacity is insufficient.
Before sizing and packing, GPU reproduction compacts each AST's name and constant tables to entries referenced by live nodes. Decoded children and fallback parents are compacted again before becoming the next population so stale table entries from prior crossover or mutation rounds cannot accumulate past fixed kernel scratch limits. A decoded child is also rejected and replaced by its selected fallback parent if any live `String` or typed-list constant lacks a host payload, preventing payload-token-only ASTs from entering later fitness or replay output.

This stage is reported as `repro_upload_ms`.

### 4. Device Selection And Variation

Source files:

- [selection_kernels.cuh](../../cpp/src/evolution/repro/gpu/device/selection_kernels.cuh)
- [variation_kernels.cuh](../../cpp/src/evolution/repro/gpu/device/variation_kernels.cuh)

The device executes two kernel families:

- tournament selection kernel
- variation kernel

Selection preserves the same high-level tournament semantics as the CPU path:

- round-based selection
- chunk size controlled by `selection_pressure`
- without-replacement within each round
- chunk winner chosen by best fitness inside that chunk

The GPU kernel still emits one mating pair per thread, but its per-round permutation is an internal device implementation detail rather than a shared host/device plan. CPU and GPU are not required to use identical RNG streams or identical within-round permutations as long as they preserve the same public tournament contract.

Selection also chooses a typed crossover site pair for each mating pair by scanning the bounded candidate tables for parent A and parent B, finding a compatible typed-subtree key, and picking one candidate with that key from each parent. The packed key includes result type, visible scope signature, binder/scheme identity, ASGP phase identity, and ASGP-DP dependency arity so device-side crossover does not exchange same-result-type roots from incompatible lexical or phase contexts.

Variation then applies the same high-level order as the CPU backend:

- every pair first attempts `typed_subtree` crossover
- each resulting child independently samples mutation from `mutation_rate`
- if a child mutates, `mutation_subtree_prob` chooses subtree mutation vs constant perturbation

GPU subtree mutation uses a type-bucketed donor pool keyed by the selected
crossover-site type. The donor pool can include conservative ASGP-DC,
ASGP-DP1D, and ASGP-DP2D donors when the active grammar config enables the
matching ASGP form and its required value, list, or builtin features. ASGP-DC,
ASGP-DP1D, and ASGP-DP2D currently cover conservative `Int`, `Float`, and
`String` targets. Constant
perturbation is applied directly to the packed child constant table after
crossover.

Variation produces packed child buffers plus child metadata such as:

- node count
- max depth
- builtin usage marker
- validity bit

The device-side child metadata parser understands the release 1.0.0 structured-expression node set (`BoundVar`, `MapList`, `FilterList`, `LinearRec`, ASGP-DC, ASGP-DP1D, and ASGP-DP2D) so valid structured children are not rejected solely because they contain structured forms.

These kernels are reported as:

- `repro_kernel_ms`
- `repro_selection_kernel_ms`
- `repro_variation_kernel_ms`

### 5. Copyback

Source files:

- [copyback.cu](../../cpp/src/evolution/repro/gpu/copyback.cu)

The backend copies back only live child regions rather than fixed-capacity slabs. Host-side pinned staging is reused across generations to keep D2H cost stable.

Copyback also returns the selected parent and candidate indices for each pair. Decode uses this context to rebuild structured side-table metadata that is not represented directly in `PlainNode`.

This stage is reported as `repro_copyback_ms`.

### 6. Decode

Source files:

- [pack.cpp](../../cpp/src/evolution/repro/pack.cpp)

The host rebuilds `ProgramGenome` children from copied-back packed buffers. This includes:

- name id lookup
- AST node reconstruction
- constant reconstruction
- `LinearRec` binder side-table reconstruction
- ASGP-DC, ASGP-DP1D, and ASGP-DP2D binder/spec side-table reconstruction
- program key regeneration
- fallback to the selected parent if the child is marked invalid or decode fails
- fallback to the selected parent if host-side lexical binder validation finds
  an escaped `BoundVar` or missing structured-expression metadata

For `LinearRec`, decode keeps base binders outside the replaced range, shifts base binders after the replaced range, and inserts donor binders whose root lies inside the donor range. Donor binder names are remapped through the copied child name table, and binder-only names are appended on the host when they were not referenced by any copied AST node.

ASGP metadata decode follows the same replacement context. It keeps ASGP
side-table entries outside the replaced range, shifts surviving entries after
the replaced range, inserts donor entries whose root lies inside the donor
range, and remaps binder names and DP boundary constants through the copied
child tables. The same path handles donor-pool ASGP-DC, ASGP-DP1D, and
ASGP-DP2D donors produced by GPU subtree mutation.

This stage is reported as `repro_decode_ms`.

## Overlap Model

Source files:

- [evolve.cpp](../../cpp/src/evolution/evolve.cpp)
- [evolve_cli.cpp](../../cpp/src/cli/evolve_cli.cpp)

When `repro_overlap` is enabled and `--engine gpu --repro-backend gpu` is active, the implementation starts reproduction preparation in a background task while GPU fitness evaluation is running.

The overlapped portion is:

- `repro_prepare_inputs_ms`
- `repro_preprocess_ms`
- `repro_pack_ms`

The non-overlapped tail remains:

- upload
- device kernels
- copyback
- decode

Because of this, overlap is only valuable when the hidden preparation work is large enough and the CPU-side preparation does not noticeably slow concurrent GPU evaluation.

## Arena Reuse

Source files:

- [gpu.cpp](../../cpp/src/evolution/repro/gpu.cpp)
- [internal.hpp](../../cpp/src/evolution/repro/gpu/internal.hpp)
- [arena.cu](../../cpp/src/evolution/repro/gpu/arena.cu)

The backend keeps a process-local runtime cache containing:

- device arena buffers
- pinned host staging buffers

This changes the timing profile:

- `repro_setup_ms` is usually a first-use or growth cost
- `repro_teardown_ms` can remain zero in steady state

This reuse is required for overlap to be worthwhile; otherwise repeated `cudaMalloc` / `cudaFree` and host allocation churn dominate short runs.

## Correctness Model

The GPU reproduction backend is not required to reproduce the exact same child sequence as the CPU backend. It is required to preserve the public GP contract:

- children must decode into valid `ProgramGenome` objects or fall back deterministically
- compiled children must remain legal under the same runtime/compiler rules
- reproduction still follows the same public high-level order: select -> typed crossover on each pair -> child-level mutation
- public CLI semantics and benchmark accounting remain stable

Fitness parity remains a CPU/GPU requirement for evaluation. Reproduction identity is not a parity contract.

## Current Bottlenecks

The backend no longer spends meaningful time inside its device kernels on normal-size runs. The remaining cost is mostly host-side:

- `repro_decode_ms`: packed child reconstruction and program key rebuild
- `repro_preprocess_ms`: subtree/candidate/donor preprocessing
- `repro_pack_ms`: flattening host ASTs into bounded upload buffers

`repro_copyback_ms` and arena lifecycle cost are much smaller after live-region copyback and reusable staging were added.

In overlap mode, improvement is limited when:

- `repro_decode_ms` dominates the post-eval tail
- background preparation contends with CPU resources needed by evaluation orchestration

## How To Read Timings

For fixed-population benchmarks built on `gagp_evolve_cli --generations 1 --skip-final-eval on`:

- compare `total_ms` first
- then inspect `eval_ms`
- then inspect reproduction subphases

For overlap mode:

- do not add all reproduction subphases and expect them to equal `repro_ms`
- `repro_ms` is the residual wall-clock cost after any hidden work
- steady-state generation timings are more meaningful than cold-start single-shot runs

## Staged compiled grammar preparation

Compiled CPU reproduction owns one `grammar::VariationContext` per generation. It retains
an immutable grammar/request, validates all parents, and preserves tournament selection
and crossover-then-child-mutation order. Legacy CPU reproduction ablations are rejected
in this mode. The existing legacy grammar-config path remains the migration reference.

Host `preprocess_population(..., VariationContext&)` uses one registry for numeric
compatibility IDs, samples logical sites without replacement and stores every physical
occurrence of shared holes. Candidate records carry separate node/depth/template budgets
and source measurements. Per-site donor offsets address contextual donors that fit those
budgets; they do not use the legacy nine-type buckets. Donor payloads exclude standalone
expression envelopes and preserve local names and decoded constant values when packed.

Preparation retains grammar ownership and materialized population/donor identities.
Packing rejects stale preparation, checks spans and contracts, and prescans capacities
instead of truncating data. Compiled program metadata has an actual candidate count;
padded candidates are invalid. Current transport caps are 512 nodes, 128 names/constants
and 256 MiB padded storage. These caps are independent of CPU evolution's grammar limits.

The explicit compiled mode is rejected by legacy GPU preparation/execution entry points,
overlap start/finish, decode and low-level allocation/upload/launch/copyback. In this stage,
use the host preparation/packing APIs to inspect contracts; device enforcement belongs
to Goal 07. Configuration copies retain shared immutable grammar ownership, and compiled
mode cannot start the legacy asynchronous overlap worker.

Variation counters accompany timing as integer counts: `crossover_attempts`,
`mutation_attempts`, `contract_rejections`, `budget_rejections`, `generation_rejections`,
`acceptance_rejections`, `fallback_children`, `unchanged_children`, `changed_children`.
They currently apply to compiled CPU operators; legacy operators report zero. Contract
and budget rejections count candidate pairs considered. Fallback is a subset of unchanged
outputs. Crossover classifies both outputs (including an odd-population discarded child),
and a later mutation classifies its output separately. These counts must not be interpreted
as final-population diversity or fitness improvement. Host donor preparation failures also
increment generation rejections on its worker context.
