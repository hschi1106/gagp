# Benchmark Manifests

This directory stores compact, reviewable evidence for release and refactor
gates. Raw run logs, generated populations, datasets, and profiler captures are
artifacts and remain outside version control.

- `spec_freeze.json` records hashes of normative specifications.
- `simple_exp_*.json` records fixed-population performance comparisons.
- `psb*.json` records PSB support, quality, and performance comparisons.
- `fixed_asgp/` records reviewed results from the [fixed ASGP/GAGP contract](../docs/guides/fixed-asgp-benchmark.md).

Every committed manifest must identify its inputs, configuration, relevant
commit(s), raw timing or quality measurements, and gate result. The commands
that produce manifests are documented in [`../tools/README.md`](../tools/README.md);
the experiment constraints are defined in
[`../docs/guides/experiment-protocol.md`](../docs/guides/experiment-protocol.md).
Do not hand-edit a measured result to make a gate pass.
