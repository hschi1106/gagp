# Bytecode ISA

This document defines the release 1.0.0 bytecode execution contract shared by the
compiler, CPU runtime, and GPU runtime.

Semantics must conform to:

- [grammar.md](./grammar.md)
- [builtins_base.md](./builtins_base.md)
- [builtins_runtime.md](./builtins_runtime.md)

The `bytecode-json` representation is defined by
[bytecode_format.md](./bytecode_format.md).

## Compatibility

Release 1.0.0 is a breaking bytecode contract relative to legacy artifacts.

- Old serialized values containing `None` are invalid.
- Old serialized values containing `NumList` are invalid.
- Old AST programs using `ast-prefix-old` are invalid as public `ast-prefix`
  inputs.
- Release 1.0.0 uses exact `Int`, `Float`, `Bool`, `Char`, `String`, `IntList`,
  `FloatList`, and `StringList` value tags.

Implementations may keep private migration tooling, but native runtime entrypoints
must not silently reinterpret old public values.

## Execution State

A VM instance has:

- instruction pointer
- operand stack
- local variable array
- constant pool
- remaining fuel
- internal local initialization state
- optional hidden locals
- optional structured-expression and ASGP frame state

Public `None` does not exist. Uninitialized storage must be tracked by an
internal validity bit, unset marker, or equivalent mechanism that cannot be
observed as a source-language value.

## Public Opcodes

The baseline public opcode set remains:

- `PUSH_CONST`
- `LOAD`
- `STORE`
- `NEG`
- `NOT`
- `ADD`
- `SUB`
- `MUL`
- `DIV`
- `MOD`
- `LT`
- `LE`
- `GT`
- `GE`
- `EQ`
- `NE`
- `JMP`
- `JMP_IF_FALSE`
- `JMP_IF_TRUE`
- `CALL_BUILTIN`
- `RETURN`

Only this public opcode set is portable between bytecode consumers. Source
forms may be lowered into it plus hidden locals and bytecode segments.

Current native private helper opcodes for structured-expression lowering are:

- `CHECK_LIST`
- `CHECK_INT`
- `EMPTY_LIST`
- `EMPTY_LIST_LIKE`
- `ASGP_DC`
- `ASGP_DP1D`
- `ASGP_DP2D`

These helpers belong to the native GAGP private execution profile. The native
`bytecode-json` codec and verifier accept them with their required segment and
metadata checks, but another consumer may reject them. No private helper opcode
adds source-language behavior beyond the public grammar contract.

## Fuel and Errors

Without an explicit semantic fuel schedule, before each instruction or equivalent
lowered operation:

```text
if fuel == 0:
    return Timeout
else:
    fuel -= 1
    execute operation
```

The staged CPU semantic fuel extension permits an optional parallel
`instruction_fuel` array on each code block. An absent or empty array retains the
unit-cost contract above. A nonempty array has exactly one integer in
`[0, INT_MAX]` per instruction. Before executing an instruction, compare the
remaining fuel with its cost: insufficient fuel returns `Timeout`; otherwise
subtract the cost and execute. A zero-cost instruction may execute with zero
remaining fuel. Charges precede operation validation, so an exhausted budget
wins over an error that the operation would otherwise produce. A charge cannot
be moved across a potentially failing operation while preserving semantics.

Every cycle in a block's control-flow graph must contain a positive-cost
instruction. Validation checks even unreachable zero-cost cycles and rejects
invalid schedules as `invalid_fuel_schedule`. This is an intraprocedural rule;
existing structured-call entry charges remain in force. Raw CPU execution also
bounds consecutive zero-cost steps by the block's instruction count and returns
`ValueError` for an unmetered cycle when verification was bypassed.

This schedule encodes semantic charges on lowered operations without changing
instruction layout. The current GPU runtime explicitly rejects any nonempty
schedule, including schedules in nested phases, until the general GPU execution
path supports them. It must never silently execute such a program with unit costs.

Structured expressions and ASGP schemes must not bypass fuel accounting.

Runtime error kinds:

- `NameError`
- `TypeError`
- `ZeroDiv`
- `ValueError`
- `Timeout`

The first runtime error terminates the current case execution.

Deterministic ASGP stack, memo, or payload overflow must map to a runtime
error result and must be treated as `-penalty` by fitness evaluation.

## Verification Boundary

Native external bytecode decoding must run the verifier described in
[bytecode_format.md](./bytecode_format.md) before execution. Debug native
compiler builds also verify their completed output. This check is a boundary
and debug invariant, not a per-case execution step or a per-individual release
hot-path requirement.

Malformed operands, indices, CFG stack joins, and segment metadata are decode
errors. Well-formed instructions whose values cause a language runtime error
remain executable so fixture suites can assert the error behavior above.

## Type-Sensitive Operators

Arithmetic operators accept `Int` and `Float` only. `Bool` and `Char` are not
numeric.

Ordering comparisons accept `Int` and `Float` only.

Equality and inequality require exact same runtime type. Comparing different
runtime types is a `TypeError` in generated well-typed programs and must not be
used as an implicit conversion mechanism.

## Builtin IDs

The builtin ID mapping below is normative for release 1.0.0 bytecode serialization.

```text
0   abs
1   min
2   max
3   clip
4   len
5   concat
6   slice
7   index
8   append
9   reverse
10  find
11  contains
12  is_int          compiler-internal helper, not source syntax
13  idiv0
14  imod0
15  prepend
16  char_to_string
17  string_to_char
18  ord
19  chr
20  is_letter
21  is_digit
22  is_space
23  is_vowel
24  to_lower
25  to_upper
26  to_string
27  singleton
```

`is_int` remains compiler-internal and is not a source-language call.

## Bound Variable Lowering

`BoundVar` is a source AST distinction used to preserve lexical scope during
generation, variation, and compilation.

Required compiler behavior:

- each structured or scheme binder maps to a hidden immutable slot or
  equivalent internal location.
- ordinary source `Var` cannot access hidden binder slots.
- source `Assign` cannot write binder slots.
- nested binders must resolve capture-safely.
- hidden slots may be reused only when lifetimes do not overlap.

## Structured List Lowering

`MapList`, `FilterList`, and `LinearRec` must preserve the evaluation order
defined in [grammar.md](./grammar.md).

Required behavior:

- source expressions are evaluated exactly once.
- binder values are assigned before body evaluation.
- bodies are evaluated exactly once when selected by the grammar semantics.
- first selected body error terminates execution.
- empty list results preserve exact static list tags.
- `LinearRec` is equivalent to right-to-left recurrence and may be lowered to
  an iterative reverse traversal.

## ASGP Execution

ASGP schemes may be represented as bytecode phase segments or equivalent
runtime-internal segments.

Required phase isolation:

- DC `solve` reads only `xs`, `n`, `lo`, and constants.
- DC `ordivide` reads only `n` and constants.
- DC `andcombine` reads only `r1`, `r2`, and constants.
- DP solve phases read only their state binders and constants.
- DP transition phases read only their state binders, dependency values, and
  constants.

ASGP implementation requirements:

- DC split is `clamp(ordivide(n), 1, n - 1)`.
- DP dependency expansion must be acyclic by grammar construction.
- out-of-bounds DP dependencies use the configured boundary value.
- memo hits must not re-evaluate already memoized states.
- DP2D phase segments carry required bounds, base cell, boundary value, and
  dependency-pattern metadata equivalent to the source grammar parameters.
- CPU implementations may use bounded recursion or explicit stacks.
- GPU implementations must use explicit bounded stacks, iterative schedules,
  or equivalent non-recursive execution.
